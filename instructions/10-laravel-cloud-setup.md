# 10 - Laravel Cloud Deployment Setup

## Goal
Prepare the application for deployment on Laravel Cloud with proper configuration and optimization.

## Laravel Cloud Requirements
- Optimize application for cloud deployment
- Configure environment variables and services
- Set up database and storage for production
- Implement proper caching and performance optimizations

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Create production-ready `.env.example` file
- Document all required environment variables
- Configure database settings for cloud deployment
- Set up mail configuration for production
- Configure file storage for cloud (S3 or similar)

### 2. Database Optimization
- Review and optimize all database migrations
- Add proper indexes for performance:
  - Events: group_id, event_datetime, status
  - RSVPs: event_id, user_id, status
  - Comments: event_id, status
  - Groups: title (for search)
- Create database seeders for initial data
- Implement proper foreign key constraints

### 3. File Storage Configuration
- Configure Laravel filesystem for cloud storage
- Set up image upload to cloud storage (S3)
- Implement proper file handling for:
  - Group banner images
  - Event images
  - User avatars (if implemented)
- Add image optimization and resizing

### 4. Caching Implementation
- Configure Redis for session and cache storage
- Implement query result caching for:
  - Event feed queries
  - Group listings
  - RSVP counts
- Set up view caching for improved performance
- Configure route caching

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implement database query optimization
- Add eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Optimize asset compilation and minification
- Set up CDN configuration for static assets
- Implement proper HTTP caching headers

### 6. Security Configuration
- Configure HTTPS enforcement
- Set up proper CSRF protection
- Configure secure session settings
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Set up proper CORS configuration if needed

### 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Configure Laravel's logging for production
- Set up error tracking (Laravel's built-in or external service)
- Implement health check endpoints
- Configure queue monitoring
- Set up application metrics collection

### 8. Queue Configuration
- Set up job queues for:
  - Image processing
  - RSVP waitlist management
- Configure queue workers for production
- Implement job retry logic and failure handling

### 9. Deployment Configuration
- Create deployment scripts
- Configure Laravel Cloud deployment hooks
- Set up database migration strategy
- Configure asset compilation pipeline
- Document deployment process

### 10. Testing for Production
- Create production-like testing environment
- Test application under load
- Verify all features work with cloud storage
- Test email delivery
- Validate caching behavior

### 11. Documentation
- Create deployment documentation
- Document environment variable requirements
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Document backup and recovery procedures

## Dependencies
- All previous modules should be complete
- Requires thorough testing of all features

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Application deploys successfully
- [ ] Database migrations run without errors
- [ ] File uploads work with cloud storage
- [ ] Caching improves performance
- [ ] All features work in production environment
- [ ] HTTPS is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling works correctly

## Security Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables are secure
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] File uploads are properly validated
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] CSRF protection is enabled
- [ ] Authentication is secure

## Performance Targets
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- API responses under 500ms
- Image uploads process quickly
- Search results return promptly
- Database queries are optimized

## Notes
- Follow Laravel Cloud best practices
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Plan for scaling if user base grows
- Monitor application performance post-deployment
- Keep security updates current
- Document all configuration decisions




# General Instructions

- Do not hallucinate features that are not specified
- Use i18n, as recommend with Laravel. Provide english and German JSON. Just the UI is i18n, event data fields are just any language (up to the creator), no fancy features for that.
- Utilize tailwind+daisy. ACtuALLy! use daisy UI components. Avoid custom CSS unless utterly necessary
- Keep the design lean. Avoid wrapping everything in five containers and cards and divs.
- Follow best practices. Use design patterns. Keep the code extensible and readable
- Think about a good folder and file structure. Adhere to DRY and single responsibility principle. Keep functions and files *short*
- Auto-detect light/darkmode and utilize via daisy/tailwind. Avoid using colors that break on dark mode.
- Keep an `ARCHITECTURE.md`, a living document for other dev on how the app is structured on high level. Do not waffle, no sycophancy, no marketing.
- Add unit tests for basic happy path.
